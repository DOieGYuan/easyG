# easyG: one command to perform genome centric metagenomics
## About
This software integrates state-of-the-art tools to conduct genome centric metagenomics for researchers who are unfamiliar with command line or have limited time in learning bioinformatics.  
  
* This pipeline is easy to use with **only one** required parameter (the working directory).  
* Seperated modules keep the pipeline flexible enough for advanced user. 
* All bioinformatic tools and parameters are selected automatically to optimize the results.    
* Assist your (genome-centric) metagenomic analysis from raw sequences to publishable figures.  
## Workflow
## Installation
You have to have git installed. If not, run ```pip install git```, or if you have root permission, run ```sudo apt-get install git``` to install it.  
Then install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) following the offical [document](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
## Quick start
First, build all prerequisites by simply run *build.sh* or install all the dependencies [manually]()
```
source build.sh
```
Then, run the pipeline
```
soure EasyGCMeta [myfolder]
```
